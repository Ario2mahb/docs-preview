You probably know about layer 1s and layer 2s. That’s the general idea.</p><p>A typical example of a modular blockchain you might’ve heard of is a rollup. Rollups host smart contracts and execute transactions, much like any monolithic chain. But, the data of those transactions get sent to a layer 1 blockchain to carry out the remaining functions.</p><p>If you want to brush up on your understanding of modular blockchains, head over to <a href="https://celestia.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">learn modular</a>.</p><h2 id="benefits-of-modular-blockchains" tabindex="-1">Benefits of modular blockchains <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits-of-modular-blockchains" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefits of modular blockchains&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="ease-of-deploying-a-chain" tabindex="-1">Ease of deploying a chain <a class="header-anchor" href="#ease-of-deploying-a-chain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ease of deploying a chain&quot;">​</a></h3><p>One of the goals of modular blockchains is to make it as easy to deploy a blockchain as a smart contract. There are a few unique ways that modular blockchains can significantly reduce the cost of deploying a new blockchain.</p><ol><li><strong>No validator set is required</strong>. Rollups can deploy without sourcing their own set of validators or sequencers.</li><li><strong>Inherit security from the start</strong>. Rollups don’t need to build all their security from scratch.</li><li><strong>Any part of the stack can be delegated</strong>. Development time can be reduced by outsourcing functions of the rollup to external providers.</li></ol><p>All in all, builders will be able to outsource as much of the stack as they need. Deploying a new blockchain will be as simple as clicking a few options to initialize a production-ready rollup.</p><h3 id="scaling" tabindex="-1">Scaling <a class="header-anchor" href="#scaling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Scaling&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Of course, a much higher scale is necessary if we want to support many more users. And modular blockchains use some new innovative technologies that can help us get there.</p><ul><li><a href="https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability-sampling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Data availability sampling</a> enables modular blockchains like Celestia to scale data availability with the number of light nodes - that means more capacity for rollups.</li><li><strong>Fraud and validity proofs</strong> make rollups vastly more efficient to verify. Nodes only need to verify a small proof of transaction validity (<a href="https://celestia.org/glossary/validity-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">validity proof</a>) or assume transactions are valid by default (<a href="https://celestia.org/glossary/state-transition-fraud-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fraud proof</a>). This means rollups don’t require every node in the network to re-execute every transaction.</li></ul><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="image"></p><ul><li><strong>Decoupling execution from consensus</strong> lets developers define the VM that best fits the scaling needs of their application.</li><li><strong>Separating applications</strong> across multiple rollups isolates congestion. If an application congests the execution capacity of one rollup, all other rollups remain unaffected in their execution capacity.</li></ul><p>All these scaling properties combined make new types of applications and features possible, like onchain gaming, dynamic metadata, and ephemeral rollups, to name a few.</p><h3 id="customizability" tabindex="-1">Customizability <a class="header-anchor" href="#customizability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Customizability&quot;">​</a></h3><p>By design, modular blockchains don’t lock in any feature set. They promote experimentation and customization.</p><p>Remember how decoupling execution from consensus enables VM customizability? Well, rollups are the execution component. Applications can run on their own rollup and adjust the VM to maximize their application&#39;s performance. Developers have that flexibility because Celestia&#39;s execution logic doesn&#39;t restrict rollups.</p><p>Basically, rollups can be customized to integrate any new or existing VM stack.</p><p>With existing rollup frameworks, developers can run rollup testnets using the EVM or Cosmos SDK. In the future, one can imagine a variety of VMs that rollup frameworks support, providing developers with more out-of-the-box options for their applications.</p><p>Some customizations that could be made to a rollup&#39;s VM include custom precompiles, changing transaction processing from sequential to parallel, or adding support for private smart contracts.</p><p>All of this only scratches the surface.</p>',24),I=JSON.parse('{"title":"Build whatever","description":"Advantages of building on modular blockchains like Celestia.","frontmatter":{"description":"Advantages of building on modular blockchains like Celestia.","head":[["meta",{"name":"og:title","content":"Build whatever | Celestia Docs"},{"name":"og:description","content":false}]]},"headers":[],"relativePath":"developers/build-whatever.md","filePath":"developers/build-whatever.md","lastUpdated":1712790232000}'),z={name:"developers/build-whatever.md"},M=Object.assign(z,{setup(c){return(u,o)=>(i(),r("div",null,[_,a("div",v,[e(t,{url:"/developers/intro-to-op-stack",imageSrc:"/build/opstack.webp",text:"OP Stack",notes:"EVM",target:"_self"}),e(t,{url:"/developers/arbitrum-integration",imageSrc:"/build/arbitrum.webp",text:"Arbitrum Orbit",notes:"EVM",target:"_self"}),e(t,{url:"/developers/build-whatever",imageSrc:"/build/polygon.webp",text:"Polygon CDK",target:"_self",notes:"EVM: Coming soon"}),e(t,{url:"https://github.com/Sovereign-Labs/sovereign-sdk/tree/stable/examples/demo-rollup#demo-rollup",imageSrc:"/build/sovereign.webp",text:"Sovereign SDK",notes:"Sovereign"}),e(t,{url:"https://dymension.xyz/",imageSrc:"/build/dymension.webp",text:"Dymension"}),e(t,{url:"https://rollkit.dev",imageSrc:"/build/rollkit.webp",text:"Rollkit",notes:"Sovereign"})]),x,S,a("div",P,[e(t,{url:"https://altlayer.io/raas/",imageSrc:"/build/altlayer.webp",text:"AltLayer",notes:"Orbit, OP Stack, Polygon CDK"}),e(t,{url:"https://www.astria.org/",imageSrc:"/build/astria.webp",text:"Astria"}),e(t,{url:"https://www.caldera.xyz/",imageSrc:"/build/caldera.webp",text:"Caldera",notes:"Orbit, OP Stack"}),e(t,{url:"https://conduit.xyz/",imageSrc:"/build/conduit.webp",text:"Conduit",notes:"Orbit, OP Stack"}),e(t,{url:"https://gateway.fm/",imageSrc:"/build/gateway.webp",text:"Gateway",notes:"Polygon CDK"}),e(t,{url:"https://www.gelato.network/",imageSrc:"/build/gelato.webp",text:"Gelato",notes:"Orbit, OP Stack, Polygon CDK"}),e(t,{url:"https://www.karnot.xyz/",imageSrc:"/build/karnot.webp",text:"Karnot",notes:"Starknet"}),e(t,{url:"https://lumoz.org/",imageSrc:"/build/lumoz.webp",text:"Lumoz",notes:"Polygon CDK"}),e(t,{url:"https://snapchain.dev/",imageSrc:"/build/snapchain.webp",text:"Snapchain",notes:"Polygon CDK"}),e(t,{url:"https://docs.vistara.dev/",imageSrc:"/build/vistara.webp",text:"Vistara"}),e(t,{url:"https://www.zeeve.io/",imageSrc:"/build/zeeve.webp",text:"Zeeve",notes:"Orbit, OP Stack, Polygon CDK"})]),C,q,a("div",D,[e(t,{url:"https://bubstestnet.com/",imageSrc:"/build/caldera.webp",text:"Bubs testnet",notes:"OP Stack"}),e(t,{url:"https://raas.gelato.network/rollups/details/public/opcelestia-raspberry",imageSrc:"/build/gelato.webp",text:"Raspberry testnet",notes:"OP Stack"})]),V]))}});export{I as __pageData,M as default};
